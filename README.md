# STM32 Car Dashboard Simulator

An embedded car dashboard simulator built on the STM32F411E-DISCO development board using STM32Cube HAL, C/C++, and STM32CubeIDE. The goal of the project is to simulate features of a modern in-vehicle computer, such as a system menu UI, sensor data display, event logging (black box), lighting control, and more.

## ðŸš— Features (Planned / In Progress)

- UART debug output and error logging
- Modular project structure in C++
- FreeRTOS-based task structure
- Menu UI controlled via rotary encoder with button
- OLED display output connected via SPI
- "Car Status" screen: voltage, tilt (IMU), temperature
- "Radio" screen: Simulated radio or music mode
- "Settings" screen (brightness, logging rate, etc.)
- LED lighting control menu (RGB strips or simulation)
- Black box style data logger (RAM or SD card)

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- STM32F411E-DISCO (STM32F411VET6 MCU)
- STM32CubeIDE + STM32CubeMX
- STM32Cube HAL
- C / C++
- UART debugging
- FreeRTOS
- SPI OLED (used 0.96' 80x160 ST7735)
- Rotary encoder input

## ðŸ”§ How to Build

1. Clone this repo
2. Open the project in **STM32CubeIDE**
3. Connect your STM32F411E-DISCO via USB (ST-LINK)
4. Click the **hammer icon** (build) and then **run** or **debug**

Alternatively, open `*.ioc` in STM32CubeMX to reconfigure peripherals.
